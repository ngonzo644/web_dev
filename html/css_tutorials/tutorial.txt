What is html/css?
- html and css are both used to create everything we see on a website
- html specifically, is a tool to create websites 
- css stands for cascading style sheets
- its used to style our html elements
- the general technique of creating a website's structure is to create elements
with html, and then style with css one-by-one

DEV TOOLS
- dev tools can be used to get perfect colors
- How does this work?
- right click on an element on any website, and click inspect 
- where it says html, click on the drop down and you can see all of you html elements,
including css code.
- if you click on the element, you can see all the properties it has (including colors)
- we can do this with any website, meaning we can copy the css properties any website has
- we can also use the target icon in inspect to click on any element on a website to see its
properties.
- However, when looking at colors when inspecting, were given a hex number.
Hex is basically the same as rgb 
first two characters represent how red
the second two represent how green
and the last two represent how blue
We can just do hex to rgb calculator with a quick google search
- You can also click on the computed tab when you have an element selected
- This will show all the final styes applied to this element

CSS BOX MODEL
- typically, its not a good idea to just use height and width properties
when editing an element using css, so we want to change the padding
- The padding refers to the spacing inside, and can be seen when inspecting and
looking at the computed tab.
- This is a better practice because text can overflow an element if the width
and height are predefined variables.
- Padding prevents this, and will adjust the element way better.
- The whole computed tab showcases the css box model, which is how much space
an element takes up, and how far it is from other elements.
- Remember, editing the padding will simply change how the element looks like(the size of it)
- It is mainly used to prevent text from overflowing, if you want overflow, change the width and height
- So to add padding, you have to account for left, right, top and bottom.
- You may notice some alignment issues to, and this can be fixed by using
vertical-align: ; in css. The value given is how you want the element to be
aligned.
- Paragraphs by default come with a margin at the top and bottom
- Margin is the size outside of the element

CSS Specificity 
- if we have multiple lines setting the same style in css, there is a priority
ladder
- The selector that is more specific will have a higher priority in style
changes

Text element
- an element inside a line of text of an html element
- will only effect the line within the text element
- uses the same html syntax just a different keyword
- The most useful one is <span></span> because it is the most generic,
meaning you can create a class tag for it, and set its own unique styles
for a specific line of text.
- So, if we want more spaced in between words, we can use <span> and then set
a specific margin using css.
- It is an INLINE element, meaning use it within an element!

THE HTML STRUCTURE
- every html file should start with <!DOCTYPE html>
and then, enclose the entire html file with
<html>
  <head></head>
  <body></body>
</html>
- this is how each html file should be structured
- as we know, an element within an element is called nesting
- every html code should either be nested inside the head, or inside the body
- <body> contains all the elements that are visible on the website
- <head> contains all the elements not visible on the website
  - For example, the <title> element changes the websites title name.
- This structure gives us the ability to automatically update our website.
- This is done through our live server vscode extension, by right clicking
on our vscode environment, and pressing open with live server.
- our css code (<style>) goes into the head element
- We actually don't need our css and html on the same file,
and we can separate it by creating a css file with the style's 
within it. In the css file, only have the properties and not
<style>. Since our css code is in a different file, we have to use the
<link> element. This is known as a void element, it does not need a closing tag.
The <link> element takes in two values, rel and href. rel indicated of what type,
and href which file. Rel has to be of "stylesheet". 

- The next project, youtube mock, will go over things such as 
search bars and images!
