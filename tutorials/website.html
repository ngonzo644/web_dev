<!-- <button>"name"</button> is to create a button to click on-->
<!-- To see your website in action, go to the file, right click, and open with-->
<p>
  paragraph of text
</p>
<!-- This <p>"text"</p> stands for paragraph, where we can put text into-->
<!-- each of these are called an html element-->
<!-- just describes what we can display on our website-->
<!-- <> and </> is just html syntax, and we need to follow it to compile correctly-->
<!-- the key identifier is called an html tag-->
<!-- every element consists of two tags, an opening and closing tag-->
<!-- In between is the content we want within it-->
<a href="https://www.youtube.com" target="_blank">
  Link to Youtube
</a>
<!-- This is an anchor element, a link to another website-->
<!-- Within the opening tag, we want to use href="link_to_website"-->
<!-- href is an html attribute, which is a modifier to how an element behaves-->
<!-- to declare an attribute, there needs to be a space between the tag name-->
<!-- href itself is an attribute name, followed by ="", the attributes value -->
<!-- the value must be surrounded by double quotes-->
<!-- href tells us were modifying the link, ="" specifies where to-->
<!-- we can actually have multiple attributes to a single html element-->
<!-- just add a space between each one so it can compile correctly-->
<!-- The target attribute determines whether this link opens in the 
current page or in a new tab -->
<!-- by setting its value to "_blank", it will open the link to a new tab-->
<!-- these attributes only work on the anchor element-->
<!-- The text within the html element will be what is displayed-->
<!-- Now we have a clickable text that takes us to a different website!-->
<!-- Another thing, extra spaces (within text) are ignored in html-->
<!-- Although this can be confusing, it allows for flexible html code-->
<!-- We can do things like 
    <p>
        hello 
    </p>   
Which is a nice way of reading html code
There is typically an ident for the tags content to differentiate between the two-->
