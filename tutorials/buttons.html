<!-- To use css, we want to create a new element called style-->
<!-- Inside we will write css code, modifying the appearance of our elements-->
<!-- We can make changes by doing "property: value;"
  Semicolons are required-->
<!-- In css, the element(s) were targeting are called selectors-->
<!-- Inside the selector, we want to change properties to the left, and
assign its values to the right-->
<!-- We can even change the height/width, and px stands for pixels-->
<!-- we can also change the rgb value by clicking on the box and playing around-->
<!-- 255, 255, 255 is white, 0,0,0 is black-->
<!-- To make a style only target a single element, we can use the
class attribute next to the opening tag. Then, set it equal to what you want
to label the element as-->
<!-- In css, if we start our selector with a ".", we can specify the class
name and change only the given element(s). Multiple elements can have the same
class attribute.-->
<!-- Within <style> is going to be all of your css code, meaning you will
  edit all elements within this.-->
<!-- Obviously, this works with all other html elements other than buttons-->
<!-- Most websites, if we hover over a button, its style changes to indicate
you can click on it-->
